# csc417-final-project
Behold, Jack and Cl√©mence's mediocre fluid simulator!
  
To run, please have OpenGL, glfw3 and libigl installed on your machine.  
(We had libigl inside an extern folder, similarly to assignments)  
  
From the src directory:  
  
`mkdir build`  
  
`cd build`  
  
`cmake ..`  
  
`make && ./csc417-final-project`
